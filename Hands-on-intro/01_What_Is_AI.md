Purpose: Explain AI in plain language

What AI Is (Beginner-Friendly Overview)

Artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT don’t think or understand.
They are prediction engines that guess the most likely next word, token, or response based on patterns in data.

Core Concepts
1. AI Is Pattern Recognition

AI models look for statistical relationships in massive datasets and use those patterns to generate new text, images, or audio.

2. AI Does Not “Know” Things

There is no internal database of facts.
When AI appears confident, it’s simply predicting high-probability wording.

3. Training vs. Use (Inference)

Training: The model learns patterns from data

Inference: The model generates output based on those learned patterns

4. AI Has Memory Limits

It only “remembers” what you give it temporarily (your conversation + uploaded files).

What AI Is Not

AI is not:

conscious

self-aware

knowledgeable in a human sense

a reliable expert

unbiased or objective

It’s a tool that produces fluent language, not guaranteed truth.

Why This Matters

Understanding the limits of AI helps you:

ask better questions

verify information

avoid overtrusting fluent language

use AI as an assistant rather than a decision-maker
