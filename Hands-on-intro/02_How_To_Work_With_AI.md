How to Work With AI Effectively

AI works best when you treat it as a collaborator that refines ideas through conversation, not a magic answer machine.

Core Principles
1. Be Specific About What You Want

Vague instructions produce vague results.
Clear goals give the model direction.

2. Use Iteration

Ask a question, review the response, adjust, and repeat.
AI improves when you guide it.

3. Expose Your Thinking

Tell the AI what you’re trying to do.
It will help you reason better if it understands your purpose.

4. Ask the AI to Ask You Questions

This prevents incorrect assumptions.
Example: “Ask me 3 clarifying questions before you answer.”

Common Productive Patterns

Explain a concept (“Explain X simply, then with more detail.”)

Compare alternatives (“Compare A vs. B for a beginner.”)

Evaluate work (“Identify missing steps in this outline.”)

Transform work (“Rewrite this for a 5-minute presentation.”)

Generate options (“Give me three approaches, not one.”)

When AI Struggles

AI tends to fail when:

your instructions are too open-ended

you rely on it for factual accuracy without verification

you skip clarifying the intended audience

you expect the model to make value judgments

Use the model for ideas, structure, clarity, and comparisons — not final answers.
