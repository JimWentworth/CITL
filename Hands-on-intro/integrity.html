  Hands-On Introduction to Generative AI
</div>

<h1>Academic Integrity in the Age of AI (Beyond Detection)</h1>

<p>
  The rise of generative AI has challenged traditional notions of academic integrity—
  particularly those based on detecting unauthorized assistance. Understanding how AI
  systems work reveals why detection-based approaches are increasingly unreliable and
  why integrity must be addressed through instructional design.
</p>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Why AI Detection Tools Fall Short</h2>

  <p>
    Most AI detection tools attempt to identify statistical patterns they associate with
    machine-generated text. However, generative AI produces language by predicting
    likely next words based on probability—the same mechanism humans use when writing
    fluently.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a result, AI-generated text does not contain stable, identifiable markers.
    Outputs vary by prompt, temperature, model version, and revision history.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Careful human writing can be flagged as AI-generated.</li>
    <li>Lightly edited AI output often evades detection.</li>
    <li>Models evolve faster than detectors can adapt.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Key idea:</strong> The absence of reliable detection is not a temporary gap.
  It is a structural consequence of how generative models work.
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Reframing Academic Integrity</h2>

  <p>
    Rather than asking, <em>“Did a student use AI?”</em> a more productive question is:
    <em>“What thinking does this assignment require, and how can that thinking be made visible?”</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Academic integrity is best supported when assignments emphasize process,
    decision-making, and reflection—elements that cannot be outsourced wholesale to an AI system.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Design Patterns That Support Integrity</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Process documentation:</strong> require drafts, outlines, annotations, or revision logs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Contextual grounding:</strong> tie work to course discussions, local data, or personal experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reflective components:</strong> ask students to explain choices, tradeoffs, or uncertainties.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Iterative feedback:</strong> incorporate checkpoints rather than single high-stakes submissions.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Example: Redesigning a Traditional Assignment</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Original:</strong> “Write a 5-page essay explaining concept X.”
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Revised:</strong>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Submit an outline with key claims and sources.</li>
    <li>Draft a short explanation of how you approached the topic.</li>
    <li>Include a reflection describing where AI tools were helpful or unhelpful.</li>
    <li>Revise based on feedback and document changes.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="wrapup">
  <h2>Conceptual Wrap-Up</h2>

  <p>
    Generative AI changes what can be produced easily—but it does not eliminate the value
    of reasoning, judgment, or reflection. Integrity-focused design makes these elements
    central rather than incidental.
  </p>

  <details>
    <summary>Show Expanded Explanation</summary>

    <p>
      When assignments focus solely on final products, it becomes difficult to distinguish
      between human and AI contributions. By contrast, assignments that foreground process
      reveal how students think, adapt, and learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach aligns academic integrity with learning goals, rather than enforcement,
      and scales as AI tools continue to evolve.

    <summary>Practical Guidance for Teaching and Academic Work</summary>

    <p>
      Be explicit about when and how AI tools may be used. Transparency reduces ambiguity
      and supports responsible use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Frame AI as a tool students can critique, not a shortcut they must hide.
    </p>

    <p>
      When appropriate, ask students to document their interaction with AI—what they tried,
      what worked, and what failed.
