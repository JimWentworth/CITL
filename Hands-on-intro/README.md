Purpose: Explains the RAG dataset and how to use it

:::

Beginner’s Guide to AI — RAG Example Set

Welcome! This folder contains four short documents used in workshops to demonstrate how AI can be grounded in written rules instead of improvising answers.

These documents intentionally:

stay short and readable

cover core concepts without jargon

contain enough structure for retrieval-based answers

disagree occasionally (on purpose!) so you can test hierarchy and conflict resolution

How to Use This Set in the Workshop

Try asking the AI questions that require:

defining AI concepts

comparing models

explaining risks

evaluating examples

following rules from these documents

Then modify a document, upload it again, and ask the same question.
You’ll see how the AI changes its behavior based on what you provide.

Authority Hierarchy for This RAG Set

README.md — Defines how the system works

01_What_Is_AI.md — Defines conceptual understanding

02_How_To_Work_With_AI.md — Defines usage patterns and rules

03_Risks_and_Safeguards.md — Defines boundaries and cautions

If two documents disagree, the higher number wins.

What This Set Represents

This is not a full curriculum.
It’s a small, controlled sandbox showing how retrieval works.

Use it to explore:

how grounding reduces hallucinations

how structured documents shape responses

how AI changes when you edit the context

Have fun experimenting!
