  Hands-On Introduction to Generative AI
</div>

<h1>Academic Integrity for Faculty</h1>

<p>
  Generative AI raises important questions about academic integrity—not only for students,
  but for faculty as instructors, scholars, and designers of learning environments.
  Faculty integrity in the age of AI is less about prohibition and more about transparency,
  judgment, and alignment with educational values.
</p>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Faculty Use of AI Is Not Inherently a Problem</h2>

  <p>
    Faculty already use a wide range of tools to support their work: spell checkers,
    citation managers, templates, and analytics software. Generative AI extends this
    pattern by assisting with drafting, brainstorming, summarizing, and revision.
  </p>

  <p>
    The integrity question is not whether AI was used, but whether its use:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Misrepresents authorship or expertise</li>
    <li>Introduces unverified or incorrect information</li>
    <li>Undermines the learning goals of a course</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Key idea:</strong> Integrity hinges on responsibility and disclosure, not on
  the absence of AI tools.
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Transparency in Teaching Materials</h2>

  <p>
    When faculty use AI to help draft syllabi, assignments, feedback examples, or
    instructional content, transparency supports trust and clarity.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Acknowledge AI assistance when appropriate</li>
    <li>Review and verify AI-generated content before sharing</li>
    <li>Ensure examples and explanations align with course context</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example syllabus language:</strong><br>
    “Portions of course materials were developed with the assistance of generative AI
    tools and reviewed by the instructor for accuracy and alignment with course goals.”
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Modeling Ethical AI Use for Students</h2>

  <p>
    Faculty behavior sets norms. How instructors talk about and demonstrate AI use
    strongly shapes student practice.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Explain when you use AI and why</li>
    <li>Demonstrate verification and revision</li>
    <li>Discuss limitations and uncertainty openly</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Modeling thoughtful AI use helps students understand that integrity involves judgment,
    not secrecy.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Designing Courses That Support Integrity</h2>

  <p>
    Faculty integrity is also expressed through course design. Clear expectations reduce
    misuse and confusion.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Specify acceptable and unacceptable uses of AI</li>
    <li>Align assignments with learning processes, not just final products</li>
    <li>Build in reflection, iteration, or explanation</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Using AI Responsibly in Scholarly Work</h2>

  <p>
    When using AI in research, writing, or professional communication, faculty should:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Verify factual claims and citations</li>
    <li>Avoid attributing original analysis to AI-generated text</li>
    <li>Follow disciplinary and publisher guidelines regarding disclosure</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AI can assist with organization and drafting, but intellectual responsibility
    remains with the scholar.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="wrapup">
  <h2>Conceptual Wrap-Up</h2>

  <p>
    Academic integrity for faculty is about stewardship—using powerful tools in ways
    that uphold learning, scholarship, and trust.
  </p>

  <details>
    <summary>Show Expanded Explanation</summary>

    <p>
      Generative AI blurs traditional boundaries between drafting and authorship.
      Faculty integrity requires making those boundaries explicit through transparency,
      verification, and intentional course design.
    </p>

    <p>
      These practices help students develop their own ethical frameworks for working
      with AI beyond a single course.
    </p>

  <details>
    <summary>Practical Guidance for Teaching and Academic Work</summary>

    <p>
      Decide in advance where AI assistance is appropriate in your own workflow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use consistent language across syllabus, assignments, and in-class discussion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Treat integrity conversations as part of learning, not enforcement.
