  Hands-On Introduction to Generative AI

<h1>Aligning Course Objectives with UIUC Learning Outcomes (Hands-On Lab)</h1>

<p>
  In this activity, you’ll build an alignment map using <strong>real learning outcomes published online</strong>
  at the University of Illinois. The goal is not to “automate” alignment, but to use AI to draft a map
  you can quickly refine with faculty judgment.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Key idea:</strong> AI can draft an alignment table quickly—but you should require it to
  stay source-based and to clearly label any uncertainty instead of guessing.
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 1 — Open the UIUC Outcomes Pages (Online Sources)</h2>

  <p>Open these official UIUC pages in new tabs:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Illinois Student Learning Outcomes (Provost):</strong>
      <a href="https://provost.illinois.edu/assessment/learning-outcomes-assessment/illinois-student-learning-outcomes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        provost.illinois.edu → Illinois Student Learning Outcomes
      </a>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>General Education Learning Outcomes:</strong>
      <a href="https://gened.illinois.edu/learning-outcomes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        gened.illinois.edu → Learning Outcomes
      </a>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>(Optional) Gen Ed outcome definitions (Provost assessment page):</strong>
      <a href="https://provost.illinois.edu/assessment/learning-outcomes-assessment/general-education-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        provost.illinois.edu → General Education Assessment (definitions)
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You’ll copy/paste outcomes from these pages into the prompt below. This keeps the AI grounded in
    the same language used by the university.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 2 — Find a Department Outcomes Page (Your Unit)</h2>

  <p>
    Many departments publish student learning outcomes. If your department has a page, open it and
    copy the outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need an example of what a department outcomes page looks like, here is one UIUC example:
    <a href="https://economics.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/learning-outcomes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      Department of Economics → Learning Outcomes
    </a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Use your own department outcomes if available. If your unit doesn’t publish outcomes online,
    use your program’s outcomes from the catalog or internal documentation.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 3 — Draft a Set of Course Objectives (or Use an Existing One)</h2>

  <p>
    Paste 3–5 course objectives below. Keep them action-oriented (analyze, evaluate, design, interpret).
    If you don’t have yours handy, start with a placeholder set and revise later.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
COURSE OBJECTIVES (paste yours here):
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 4 — Run the Alignment Prompt (Source-Based)</h2>

  <p>
    Copy the prompt below into your AI tool. Then paste:
    (1) your course objectives, (2) your department outcomes, and (3) UIUC outcomes from the pages above.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
You are helping me create an alignment map for a UIUC course.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Use ONLY the outcomes I paste below.
- Do NOT invent outcomes, categories, or wording.
- If something does not clearly align, say "No strong match" and explain why.
- Keep the output concise and instructor-friendly.

TASK:
1) Create an alignment table with one row per COURSE OBJECTIVE.
2) For each objective, map it to:
   - a Department outcome (if applicable)
   - one UIUC Illinois Student Learning Outcome (if applicable)
   - one UIUC Gen Ed core outcome (if applicable)
3) Add a brief justification (1–2 sentences) per row explaining the match.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Table with columns:
Course Objective | Dept Outcome | UIUC Student Learning Outcome | UIUC Gen Ed Core Outcome | Justification

PASTE CONTENT BELOW:

COURSE OBJECTIVES:
[paste here]

DEPARTMENT OUTCOMES:
[paste here]

UIUC ILLINOIS STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES (from Provost page):
[paste here]

UIUC GENERAL EDUCATION OUTCOMES (from Gen Ed page):
[paste here]
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 5 — Stress-Test the Draft (Anti-Hallucination Check)</h2>

  <p>
    Now run a second prompt to check whether the AI accidentally stretched or guessed. This step is
    where “alignment” becomes credible.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
Review the alignment table you just produced.

1) Identify any rows where the mapping is weak, ambiguous, or based on assumptions.
2) For each weak row, propose one of the following:
   - a tighter rewrite of the COURSE OBJECTIVE to improve alignment, OR
   - an alternative mapping using ONLY the pasted outcomes, OR
   - "No strong match" if alignment is not appropriate.
3) Do NOT invent outcomes. Quote the exact outcome wording you relied on when you claim a match.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 6 — Translate Alignment into Assessment Evidence</h2>

  <p>
    Alignment becomes meaningful when it connects to what students actually do.
    For 1–2 objectives, add:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Which assignment demonstrates the objective?</li>
    <li><strong>Criteria:</strong> What would “meeting the outcome” look like?</li>
    <li><strong>Checkpoint:</strong> Where in the course will students practice before being assessed?</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
For the two course objectives below, propose:
- one assignment that provides evidence,
- 2–3 criteria I could put in a rubric,
- one low-stakes practice activity before the graded work.

Use only what I paste. Keep suggestions realistic for a single course.

OBJECTIVES:
[paste 1–2 objectives here]

COURSE CONTEXT (optional):
[level, class size, discipline, typical assignments]
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="wrapup">
  <h2>Conceptual Wrap-Up</h2>

  <p>
    Alignment is strongest when it is <strong>traceable</strong>: a reader should be able to see how
    course objectives support department and campus priorities—and how assignments generate evidence of learning.
  </p>

    <p>
      AI can accelerate the “first draft” of alignment, but alignment is ultimately a faculty judgment call.
      The most durable approach is to (1) paste authoritative outcomes, (2) require the model not to invent,
      and (3) run a second pass that challenges weak mappings and proposes revisions.
    </p>
  </details>
</div>

<div class="wrapup">
  <details>
    <summary>Practical Guidance for Teaching and Academic Work</summary>
    <p>
      If you’re short on time, align just 3–5 core objectives for the course rather than everything.
      Use the alignment table as a living document you revisit during assignment updates or program review.
    </p>
    <p>
      If outcomes language feels too broad, rewrite course objectives to be more specific about what students
      will produce, justify, or demonstrate. That specificity makes alignment easier—and grading clearer.
