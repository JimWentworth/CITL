  Hands-On Introduction to Generative AI

<h1>Individualizing Your Learning with AI</h1>

<p>
  Used well, AI can act like a flexible study partner: it can explain concepts in different ways,
  generate practice questions, quiz you, and help you plan study time. The goal is not to “get answers,”
  but to build understanding—and to stay aligned with your course’s academic integrity expectations.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Key idea:</strong> The safest learning workflows use AI to <em>coach</em> your thinking (questions,
  feedback, practice) rather than to <em>replace</em> your thinking (final answers you submit).
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 1 — Set Your “Study Profile” (1 minute)</h2>
  <p>
    Start by telling the AI what you’re learning and what kind of help you want. This keeps responses
    focused and makes your study sessions more consistent.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
I am studying: [course/topic]
My current level: [new to this / intermediate / advanced]
My goal for today: [e.g., understand key concepts / prepare for quiz / solve problems]
My constraint: [time available, e.g., 25 minutes]
Important: Do not do graded work for me. Help me learn by asking questions and giving feedback.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 2 — Choose a Personalization Mode</h2>
  <p>Pick one mode depending on what you need right now:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Explain it differently:</strong> simpler, more technical, analogy-based, or step-by-step</li>
    <li><strong>Practice:</strong> generate questions and quiz you</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnose:</strong> identify what you misunderstand and fix it</li>
    <li><strong>Plan:</strong> create a study plan with spaced review</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Mode A — “Explain It Differently” (Clarity and Comprehension)</h2>
  <p>
    When a reading or lecture isn’t clicking, ask for a different explanation style. Then check your
    understanding by answering a question without looking.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
Explain [concept] in two ways:
1) a plain-language explanation for a first-year student
2) a more technical explanation using correct terms

Then ask me 3 short questions to check my understanding.
Do not provide the answers until I respond.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Mode B — “Practice and Quiz Me” (Active Recall)</h2>
  <p>
    The fastest way to learn is often active recall. Use AI to generate practice questions and keep you honest.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
Create a practice quiz on [topic] with:
- 5 multiple-choice questions
- 3 short-answer questions
- 1 challenge question

After each question, wait for my answer.
Then give feedback and explain what I missed.
Keep going until we finish.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <strong>Tip:</strong> Tell the AI what materials the questions should be based on (lecture slides, chapter, notes)
    so practice matches your course.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Mode C — “Diagnose My Understanding” (Find the Real Gap)</h2>
  <p>
    If you’re getting stuck, ask the AI to identify where your reasoning breaks down. This works well for
    problem-solving, explanations, and arguments.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
I will explain my understanding of [topic] below.

Your job:
1) Identify the first point where my explanation becomes unclear or incorrect.
2) Ask me 2 probing questions to pinpoint the misunderstanding.
3) Give a corrected explanation only after I respond.

Here is my explanation:
[paste your explanation here]
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Mode D — “Plan My Studying” (Spaced Review)</h2>
  <p>
    AI can help you build a realistic plan that fits your schedule. The key is to keep it short and specific.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
I have [X] days until my [quiz/exam/project].
I can study [minutes/hours] per day.
Topics I need to cover:
1)
2)
3)

Create a study plan that includes:
- short daily tasks
- spaced review (return to earlier topics)
- 1 self-test checkpoint before the assessment
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Stay on the Right Side of Integrity</h2>
  <p>
    AI becomes risky when it starts producing work you submit as your own, especially if your instructor
    restricts AI use. If you’re unsure, ask your instructor.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Safer uses:</strong> practice questions, explanations, feedback on your draft, study planning</li>
    <li><strong>Riskier uses:</strong> generating final answers, writing full submissions, creating citations</li>
    <li><strong>Best habit:</strong> keep a short note of how you used AI for major assignments</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="wrapup">
  <h2>Conceptual Wrap-Up</h2>

  <p>
    Individualized learning is powerful when it increases <strong>active engagement</strong>: questions,
    practice, feedback, and revision. AI can help personalize these steps—but learning still requires your
    effort and judgment.
  </p>

  <details>
    <summary>Show Expanded Explanation</summary>
    <p>
      AI is good at adapting explanations and generating endless practice. It is not a guarantee of accuracy,
      and it can sometimes sound confident while being wrong. The most effective approach is to use AI for
      coaching and then verify understanding through self-testing and course materials.
    </p>
  </details>
</div>

<div class="wrapup">
  <details>
    <summary>Practical Guidance for Students</summary>
    <p>
      Use AI after you’ve tried: attempt the problem first, then ask for hints or feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ask for questions, not answers. If you can answer the questions without help, you’re learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When stakes are high (graded work), follow your instructor’s rules and disclose tool use if required.
