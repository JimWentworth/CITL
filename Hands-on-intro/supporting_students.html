  Hands-On Introduction to Generative AI
</div>

<h1>Faculty, Students, and Academic Integrity in the Age of AI</h1>

<p>
  Generative AI has changed how students approach coursework. For faculty, the challenge is
  not simply identifying AI use, but establishing clear expectations that support learning,
  fairness, and trust.
</p>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Start with Clarity, Not Assumptions</h2>

  <p>
    Students bring widely varying assumptions about what is allowed when using AI.
    Some assume everything is prohibited; others assume everything is permitted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Academic integrity is best supported when faculty clearly communicate:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>When AI use is allowed, limited, or not permitted</li>
    <li>What kinds of assistance are acceptable (brainstorming, editing, checking)</li>
    <li>What responsibilities remain with the student</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Key idea:</strong> Ambiguity about AI use increases misuse. Clarity reduces it.
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Frame AI as a Tool, Not a Shortcut</h2>

  <p>
    Students are more likely to engage responsibly with AI when it is framed as a tool
    that supports learning rather than a way to bypass it.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Explain how AI can help with practice, feedback, or revision</li>
    <li>Emphasize that understanding and judgment cannot be outsourced</li>
    <li>Reinforce that students remain accountable for accuracy and reasoning</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Use Assignment Design to Reinforce Integrity</h2>

  <p>
    Many integrity concerns can be addressed through design rather than enforcement.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Include reflection or process explanations</li>
    <li>Require connections to course-specific material</li>
    <li>Break large assignments into stages</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example requirement:</strong><br>
    “Briefly describe how you approached this assignment, including any tools or resources
    you used and why.”
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Responding When AI Use Is Unclear</h2>

  <p>
    When faculty suspect inappropriate AI use, the goal should be understanding before
    escalation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ask students to explain their thinking or choices</li>
    <li>Focus on learning gaps rather than tool use</li>
    <li>Document expectations and conversations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In many cases, a conversation clarifies misunderstanding and reinforces expectations
    more effectively than punitive action.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Teaching Students to Disclose AI Use</h2>

  <p>
    Disclosure normalizes responsible use and discourages concealment.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Allow brief AI-use statements or footnotes</li>
    <li>Clarify that disclosure is about transparency, not punishment</li>
    <li>Model disclosure in your own materials</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example disclosure language for students:</strong><br>
    “I used an AI tool to brainstorm initial ideas and revise wording. All analysis and
    final decisions are my own.”
  </div>
</div>

<div class="wrapup">
  <h2>Conceptual Wrap-Up</h2>

  <p>
    Academic integrity in an AI-enabled classroom is a shared responsibility.
    Faculty set the conditions; students practice judgment within them.
  </p>

  <details>
    <summary>Show Expanded Explanation</summary>

    <p>
      When integrity is framed solely as rule enforcement, students may focus on hiding
      tool use rather than learning how to use tools well. Transparent expectations and
      reflective design shift attention back to learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, these practices help students develop ethical habits that extend beyond
      a single course.

  <details>
    <summary>Practical Guidance for Teaching and Academic Work</summary>

    <p>
      Revisit AI expectations at multiple points in the term, not just in the syllabus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use consistent language across assignments and feedback.
    </p>

    <p>
      Treat integrity conversations as instructional moments whenever possible.
