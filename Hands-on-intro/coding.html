<h1>Using Claude for Basic Coding Tasks</h1>

<p>
  Generative AI tools like Claude can support basic coding tasks even for educators with
  little or no programming background. The goal is not to become a software developer,
  but to use code as a flexible tool for problem-solving, automation, and experimentation.
</p>

<div class="step">
  <h2>What Claude Is Good At</h2>

  <p>
    Claude excels at working with existing code, explaining how it functions, and making
    small, targeted changes. This makes it especially useful for educators who want to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Understand what a piece of code is doing</li>
    <li>Modify a script without writing it from scratch</li>
    <li>Translate ideas into simple, working examples</li>
    <li>Learn by iterating and asking follow-up questions</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>How to Approach Coding with AI</h2>

  <p>
    When using Claude for coding, think in terms of <em>collaboration</em>, not automation.
    Start with a clear goal and let the model help you reason through the solution.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Describe the problem in plain language</li>
    <li>Ask for short, readable code examples</li>
    <li>Request explanations alongside code</li>
    <li>Iterate in small steps rather than big rewrites</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Example: A Simple Data Task</h2>

  <p>
    Suppose you have a CSV file of student survey responses and want to count how many
    times each response appears.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
I am new to coding.
Write a short Python script that reads a CSV file and counts how many times
each value appears in a specific column.
Explain each part of the code in plain language.
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Claude can generate a working example and explain how variables, loops,
    and functions work—allowing you to focus on understanding rather than syntax.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Using Code as a Thinking Tool</h2>

  <p>
    Even if you never run the code yourself, reading and discussing code can support
    learning goals.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ask Claude to explain what would happen if a value changes</li>
    <li>Request alternative versions of the same solution</li>
    <li>Use code examples to clarify logic, not just execution</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Key idea:</strong> Coding with AI is less about producing perfect programs and
  more about making reasoning explicit, testable, and revisable.
</div>

<div class="wrapup">
  <h2>Conceptual Wrap-Up</h2>

  <p>
    Claude lowers the barrier to working with code by translating between natural language
    and programming logic. This enables educators to engage with computational ideas
    without requiring extensive prior experience.
  </p>

    <summary>Show Expanded Explanation</summary>

    <p>
      Programming languages are precise and unforgiving. AI models help bridge the gap
      by explaining errors, rewriting unclear sections, and offering alternative approaches.
      This makes coding a more accessible medium for exploration and learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      As with any AI-generated output, code should be reviewed, tested, and adapted
      before being used in real contexts.
    </p>
  </details>
</div>

<div class="wrapup">
  <details>
    <summary>Practical Guidance for Teaching and Academic Work</summary>

    <p>
      Start with small, authentic tasks rather than abstract programming exercises.
    </p>

    <p>
      Encourage students to explain what code does in their own words, not just whether it runs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Treat AI-generated code as a draft—something to inspect, critique, and improve.
