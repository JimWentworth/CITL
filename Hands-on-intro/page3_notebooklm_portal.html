<h1>NotebookLM and Retrieval Augmented Generation</h1>

<p>
  Now that you've seen the limits of a model’s context window, this activity shifts toward
  solving that problem through <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong>. NotebookLM is
  designed to ingest large documents, break them into chunks, and retrieve only the pieces
  relevant to your question. This grounding makes it dramatically more accurate with long,
  complex source materials.
</p>

<p>
  Even more importantly for teaching, NotebookLM can now generate <strong>multimodal studio
  assets</strong>—presentations, outlines, audio summaries, and study guides—directly from your
  documents. In this activity you’ll upload the same 304-page Energy & AI PDF and create usable
  teaching materials from it.
</p>

<p>
  Unlike Copilot or Gemini, NotebookLM uses
  <strong>only the uploaded documents</strong> when answering a question. This creates predictable,
  grounded responses and enables the creation of  interactive learning features such as mind maps, video
  explanations, audio summaries, and structured study guides. </p>
	
	<!-- STEP 1 -->
<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 1 — Uploading documents to Notebook LM</h2>
<p>
    Login to Notebook LM with a Google account.
  </p>
	    <button class="notebook-btn" onclick="openNotebookLM()">Open NotebookLM</button>
  <p>
    Create a new Notebook and add the Energy doc as the single source. You can always add more later, Notebook LM allows up to 50 individual sources for each Notebook.
  </p>
	</div>
<!-- STEP 2 -->
	<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 2 — Ask Questions in the Notebook Chat Window</h2>
  <p>
    Just like in Copilot, you type questions into the central chat window. But the results differ:
    NotebookLM only references the uploaded sources. Try asking:
  </p>

  <p><em>“What are the primary arguments made in the first three sections?”</em></p>

  <p>
    Notice how NotebookLM responds with citations and references drawn entirely from your
    sources. No external knowledge is blended in unless you uploaded it.
  </p>

  <div class="note-box">
    <strong>Key Difference:</strong> ChatGPT and Copilot blend general model knowledge with the
    document. NotebookLM does not. This makes it ideal for academic readings and
    student-facing assignments where grounding matters.
  </div>
</div>

<!-- STEP 3 -->
<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 3 — Generate a Mind Map</h2>
  <p>
    In the Studio panel, select “Generate Mind Map.” NotebookLM will create a visual branch
    structure of the document’s key ideas, sections, and relationships. This is especially effective
    for students who benefit from spatial or conceptual mapping.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can&nbsp; interact with the map by clicking nodes to reveal deeper connections or related
    excerpts. This turns passive reading into exploratory learning. When you click a node it passes that back to the chat window for deeper explanation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
</div>

<!-- STEP 4 -->
<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 4 — Generate a Video Explanation</h2>
  <p>
    Use the “Generate Video Summary” feature. NotebookLM will produce a short narrated video
    covering main themes, arguments, and evidence. This provides a different modality for students
    who learn more effectively through audiovisual content.
  </p>

  <div class="note-box">
    Many instructors use this to provide pre-class briefings or flipped-classroom preparation.
  </div>
</div>

<!-- STEP 5 -->
<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 5 — Create an Audio Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Use the “Audio Overview” tool. NotebookLM creates a spoken, conversational walkthrough of
    the document’s main points. Students can listen while commuting, exercising, or reviewing.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- STEP 6 -->
<div class="step">
  <h2>Step 6 — Create a Sharable Study Guide</h2>
  <p>
    Select “Generate Study Guide.” NotebookLM will produce a structured set of questions,
    explanations, summaries, and section breakdowns—based entirely on the uploaded documents.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can share this Notebook with students so they explore the materials, ask their own
    questions, and interact with the assets you generated.
  </p>

  <div class="note-box">
    NotebookLM maintains academic integrity by grounding everything in the source material—
    no hallucinations based on outside information.
  </div>
</div>

<!-- WRAP-UP -->
<div class="wrapup">
  <h2>Conceptual Wrap-Up</h2>

  <p> NotebookLM serves as a focused learning portal built around the documents you choose.
    Students explore ideas in multiple modalities—text, mind maps, audio, and video—without
    risking drift into unrelated or incorrect general-information territory. This makes NotebookLM
    ideal for literature reviews, dense readings, technical texts, and structured course materials. </p>
  <p><a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/d786206f-ff1f-4680-a55a-f52f70d88c55" target="_blank">See the Energy and AI Notebook</a></p>
<details>
    <summary>Show Detailed Explanation</summary>

    <p>
      NotebookLM’s strict grounding in uploaded sources means it avoids a major failure mode of
      general LLMs: blending correct information from a document with plausible but inaccurate
      world knowledge. This is especially important in academic contexts where alignment with
      assigned readings matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The multimodal Studio tools—mind maps, video summaries, structured outlines, audio
      guides—sit on top of this retrieval architecture. Because each output is based entirely on your
      source documents, students can rely on the accuracy of the materials and see direct citations
      back to the original text.
    </p>

    <p>
      By treating NotebookLM as a shareable learning environment, you shift from asking students
      to digest dense texts on their own to giving them a guided exploratory space where they can
      examine ideas visually, verbally, and interactively.
