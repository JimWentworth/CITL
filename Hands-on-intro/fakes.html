  Hands-On Introduction to Generative AI
</div>

<h1>Spotting AI-Generated Images and Videos</h1>

<p>
  As generative AI tools become more accessible, synthetic images and videos—often called
  “AI fakes” or “deepfakes”—are increasingly common in academic, professional, and public
  contexts. Developing the ability to critically evaluate visual media is now a core
  component of AI literacy.
</p>

<div class="step">
  <h2>First Principle: There Is No Single “Tell”</h2>

  <p>
    AI-generated images and videos are created by probabilistic models trained on massive
    collections of visual data. Because the technology evolves quickly, there is no
    permanent checklist that reliably identifies every AI fake.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of looking for one giveaway detail, effective detection relies on combining
    multiple signals: visual artifacts, contextual inconsistencies, and source verification.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Common Signs in AI-Generated Images</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Anatomical inconsistencies:</strong> extra or misshapen fingers, asymmetrical eyes,
      distorted ears, or unnatural joint angles.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Texture and detail errors:</strong> smeared text, unreadable signage, repeating
      background patterns, or inconsistent lighting.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Boundary confusion:</strong> objects blending into one another or unclear edges
      between foreground and background.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Style mismatch:</strong> highly realistic subjects combined with painterly or
      overly smooth textures.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These issues occur because image models optimize for visual plausibility rather than
    physical correctness.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Common Signs in AI-Generated Videos</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Temporal instability:</strong> faces, hands, or objects subtly changing shape
      from frame to frame.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Unnatural motion:</strong> stiff facial expressions, limited blinking, or
      movements that feel slightly delayed or smoothed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Audio-visual mismatch:</strong> lip movements that don’t precisely align with
      speech, or vocal tone that lacks natural variation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Background drift:</strong> walls, shadows, or objects subtly shifting over time.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Key idea:</strong> AI fakes often look convincing at a glance. Detection improves
  when viewers slow down, rewatch, zoom in, and consider context—not just visual quality.
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>Contextual and Source-Based Red Flags</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Missing provenance:</strong> no clear source, creator, or original publication.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Improbable scenarios:</strong> events that would likely be widely reported
      elsewhere but appear only in a single clip.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Emotional manipulation:</strong> content designed to provoke outrage, fear,
      or urgency without supporting evidence.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Metadata gaps:</strong> stripped or inconsistent metadata in image or video files.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="wrapup">
  <h2>Conceptual Wrap-Up</h2>

  <p>
    AI-generated visuals are best understood as statistically plausible reconstructions
    rather than recordings of real events. They prioritize what <em>looks right</em> over
    what <em>actually happened</em>.
  </p>

  <details>
    <summary>Show Expanded Explanation</summary>

    <p>
      Image and video generation models predict pixel values and motion patterns based on
      probability. This means they are excellent at reproducing familiar visual motifs,
      but weaker at enforcing physical laws, continuity, and causal history.
    </p>

    <p>
      As models improve, surface-level artifacts will become harder to spot. Long-term
      detection strategies will increasingly depend on contextual literacy, verification,
      and understanding how generative systems work.

    <summary>Practical Guidance for Teaching and Academic Work</summary>

    <p>
      When using images or videos in teaching materials, encourage students to ask:
      <em>Who created this? Where did it come from? What evidence supports it?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider classroom activities where students compare real and AI-generated visuals,
      document observed artifacts, and reflect on uncertainty rather than aiming for
      perfect classification.
    </p>

    <p>
      Framing AI fakes as a literacy challenge—not a guessing game—helps students build
      durable critical skills.
