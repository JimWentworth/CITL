  Hands-On Introduction to Generative AI
</div>

<h1>Accessibility + AI: Practical Uses for Teaching Materials</h1>

<p>
  Generative AI can support accessibility work by helping instructors create alternative formats,
  simplify language, draft image descriptions, and identify potential barriers in course materials.
  The key is to treat AI as a <strong>drafting assistant</strong>—you remain responsible for accuracy,
  tone, and alignment with accessibility standards.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Key idea:</strong> AI can reduce time spent on “first drafts” of accessibility work, but
  human review is still required—especially for technical accuracy, sensitive topics, and inclusive language.
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>High-Impact, Low-Effort AI Uses for Accessibility</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Alt text drafts</strong> for instructional images (then revise)</li>
    <li><strong>Plain-language rewrites</strong> of dense instructions or policies</li>
    <li><strong>Structured headings</strong> and page organization suggestions</li>
    <li><strong>Caption and transcript cleanup</strong> (formatting, punctuation, speaker labels)</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility “linting”</strong>: asking AI to flag likely barriers</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>1) Alt Text Drafting (and How to Make It Good)</h2>

  <p>
    Alt text should communicate what matters for the learning goal. A good workflow is:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Describe the instructional purpose of the image</li>
    <li>Ask AI for a first draft alt text</li>
    <li>Revise to include only essential details (and any data shown)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
Write alt text for the image described below.

INSTRUCTIONAL CONTEXT:
[What is the course/topic? What should students learn from this image?]

IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
[What is in the image? Include any text labels, axes, or key visual elements.]

REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep it concise (1–2 sentences) unless the image is data-heavy.
- Prioritize details needed to understand the learning point.
- Do not add interpretation that is not visible in the image.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <strong>Tip:</strong> If the image is a chart, diagram, or infographic, consider adding a longer
    description below the image (a “long description”) with key values, trends, or steps.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>2) Plain-Language Rewrites (Without “Dumbing Down”)</h2>

  <p>
    Plain language improves clarity for everyone (including multilingual learners, students with
    cognitive load challenges, and students new to academic conventions). Ask for a rewrite that
    keeps meaning but reduces complexity.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
Rewrite the text below into plain language for a college audience.

GOALS:
- Keep the meaning and requirements exactly the same.
- Use shorter sentences and clear headings.
- Avoid jargon unless it is defined.
- Preserve dates, grading rules, and constraints.

TEXT:
[paste your assignment instructions or policy here]
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>3) Make Structure Visible (Headings, Lists, and Scannability)</h2>

  <p>
    Many accessibility barriers come from structure: long paragraphs, missing headings, unclear task steps.
    You can use AI to propose a more scannable layout.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
Improve the structure of the content below for accessibility and scannability.

OUTPUT:
- Provide a revised version with clear headings (H2/H3 style labels),
- Short paragraphs,
- Numbered steps where appropriate,
- A checklist at the end.

CONTENT:
[paste text here]
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>4) Captions and Transcripts: Cleanup and Formatting</h2>

  <p>
    If you already have captions or a transcript (auto-generated or human-produced), AI can help
    fix punctuation, add speaker labels, and improve readability—without changing meaning.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
Edit the transcript below for readability.

RULES:
- Do not change the meaning.
- Fix punctuation and capitalization.
- Add speaker labels if they are obvious.
- Keep specialized terms as written.
- If you are unsure about a word, mark it as [inaudible] rather than guessing.

TRANSCRIPT:
[paste transcript here]
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <h2>5) Quick Accessibility “Pre-Check” for Documents</h2>

  <p>
    AI cannot fully test accessibility, but it can flag common issues early—especially in
    assignment instructions and web content.
  </p>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <div class="prompt-text">
Review the content below and flag potential accessibility barriers.

LOOK FOR:
- Missing or unclear headings
- Long dense paragraphs
- Ambiguous instructions
- Color-dependent directions (e.g., “click the green button”)
- Unexplained acronyms or jargon
- Anything that could confuse screen-reader users

OUTPUT:
- A short list of likely issues
- A revised version of 1–2 problem sections as examples

CONTENT:
[paste text here]
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <strong>Reminder:</strong> Automated tools (and human review) are still needed for full accessibility checks
    (e.g., contrast, heading hierarchy in actual files, PDF tagging, keyboard navigation).
  </div>
</div>

<div class="wrapup">
  <h2>Conceptual Wrap-Up</h2>

  <p>
    Accessibility improves learning for everyone. AI can accelerate common accessibility tasks by
    generating drafts—alt text, clearer language, better structure—so you can spend time on
    review and instructional quality rather than repetitive formatting work.
  </p>

  <details>
    <summary>Show Expanded Explanation</summary>
    <p>
      AI-generated accessibility drafts are best treated as “starting points.” They can be incomplete,
      too vague, or overly detailed. The strongest workflows include context (what learners need to do),
      constraints (what not to change), and a quick human check for accuracy and tone.
    </p>
  </details>
</div>

<div class="wrapup">
  <details>
    <summary>Practical Guidance for Teaching and Academic Work</summary>
    <p>
      Pick one high-impact target: alt text for key images, clearer assignment instructions, or transcript cleanup.
      Use AI to draft, then revise with your course goals in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      If students create accessible materials, you can adapt these prompts into a learning activity:
      students draft alt text, compare versions, and justify which details matter for comprehension.
    </p>
