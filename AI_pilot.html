<section id="intro" class="panel active" role="tabpanel">
  <h2>Why this pilot exists</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of this pilot is not to standardize on a single AI tool, but to understand
    how different <a href="https://genai.illinois.edu/ai-app" target="_blank">campus-endorsed tools</a> support the diverse work happening across the teaching center.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rather than asking “Which tool is better?”, this pilot asks:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Where does AI reduce friction in our existing workflows?</li>
    <li>Where does it introduce new risks or overhead?</li>
    <li>Which environments align with different roles and responsibilities?</li>
  </ul>
	<h2>Balancing Innovation with Awareness</h2>

	<p> We understand there are legitimate concerns about AI usage including potential cognitive impacts, environmental concerns and the changing nature of how we all work and learn. We don’t intend to ignore these concerns, but we  acknowledge we have a responsibility to help our campus community understand how these tools will shape the future of education and to do so thoughtfully and transparently.</p>
	<p>That means keeping in mind a few guiding principles: </p>
	<p><strong>Privacy First: </strong>Use AI in ways that respect institutional privacy expectations and data stewardship responsibilities. Avoid entering student records, personnel information, or other protected data unless the tool and context are explicitly approved for that use.</p>
	<p><strong>Ethics and Transparency: </strong>Use AI in ways that align with our commitments to inclusivity, academic integrity, and fairness. When AI meaningfully contributes to your work, be transparent about its role and retain human responsibility for final decisions and outputs.</p>
	<p><strong>Responsible Innovation:</strong> This pilot encourages experimentation—but not novelty for its own sake. Use AI where it genuinely reduces friction, improves clarity, or enhances the quality of our work. Favor practices that can scale beyond individual use and be sustained over time, rather than workflows that rely on fragile setups or one-off expertise.</p>
	<p><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> Match the level of oversight, review, and validation to the potential consequences of the AI’s role. Assess risk based on how AI outputs are used and the potential impact of error, not just the tool itself. Low-impact uses (such as generating first drafts or brainstorming ideas) carry different risks than high-impact uses (such as creating assessment materials, decision-support tools, or student-facing systems).</p>
<h2>What this pilot is — and is not</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Is:</strong> A structured opportunity to explore AI in context</li>
    <li><strong>Is:</strong> A way to inform future institutional decisions</li>
    <li><strong>Is not:</strong> A measure of individual skill or adoption readiness</li>
    <li><strong>Is not:</strong> An endorsement of AI-generated output as authoritative</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Available Tools</h2>
  <p>This pilot focuses primarily on ChatGPT EDU and Micrsoft 365 Copilot Suite Add-on. Use the buttons above for more information and as you review the options focus on these factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Workflow:</strong> What kinds of information you handle and where your work actually happens</li>
    <li><strong>Data sensitivity:</strong> What kinds of information you handle and what institutional protection your work requires</li>
    <li><strong>Risk tolerance:</strong> What level of risk your work entails, who could potentially be impacted by errors.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    This pilot is focused on campus-supported tools only. If your position at CITL would be best supported by licening another tool, please speak with your supervisor.

<!-- COPILOT PANEL -->
<section id="copilot" class="panel" role="tabpanel" hidden>
  <h2>Microsoft Copilot 365 Add-on</h2>

  <p>
    Microsoft Copilot is best understood as an <strong>embedded productivity assistant</strong>.
    Its value comes less from raw generation and more from operating directly inside
    the Microsoft 365 ecosystem where work already happens. Everyone on campus already has access to the free version of Copilot. The 365 add-on allows full integration of copilot chat across your Microsoft 365 apps.
  </p>
	
	<p>Eligibility: Faculty and Staff via a subscription from <a href="https://webstore.illinois.edu/shop/search.aspx?keyword=copilot&shopby=2" target="_blank">WebStore</a>.

  <h3>What Copilot is good at</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Drafting, revising, and summarizing documents <em>in place</em></li>
    <li>Transforming spreadsheets into explanations, summaries, or action items</li>
    <li>Reducing friction in email and meeting-heavy workflows</li>
    <li>Surfacing patterns across documents, chats, and files (permission-dependent)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What Copilot is not designed for</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Open-ended conceptual exploration detached from documents</li>
    <li>Pedagogical reasoning or instructional design without strong prompting</li>
    <li>Replacing human judgment in decision-making or evaluation</li>
  </ul>

	<!-- PARTICIPATION PANEL -->
<section id="participate" class="panel" role="tabpanel" hidden>
  <h2>How to Participate in the Pilot</h2>

  <p>
    This pilot is designed to generate actionable evidence about tool fit, workflow impact, and risk-aware practice.
    Participation is lightweight—but it must be measurable and documentable enough to inform future decisions. This is intended to be a year-long pilot running through the end of calendar year 2026.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 1 — Choose your tool (and choose intentionally)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Select one tool</strong> for the pilot period: Microsoft Copilot (paid) or ChatGPT Education.</li>
    <li>Use the tool tab comparisons to match your choice to how you work:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Microsoft 365 / Teams-heavy workflows</strong> → Copilot is often the better fit.</li>
        <li><strong>Drafting, synthesis, planning, and iterative thinking</strong> → ChatGPT Education is often the better fit.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Risk note:</strong> If your work includes protected or sensitive information, default to tools and workflows explicitly approved for that level of data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 2 — Define one measurable goal</h3>
  <p>
    Pick a single workflow you can reasonably test and improve. Write your goal so someone else can tell whether it worked.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Goal template:</strong>
    <br />
    <span class="muted">“Over the pilot period, I will use <em>[tool]</em> to improve <em>[workflow]</em> by <em>[measurable outcome]</em>, measured by <em>[how I will measure it]</em>.”</span>
  </div>

  <h4>Examples of measurable goals</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Time reduction:</strong> “Reduce time to produce a first draft of a workshop outline from 90 minutes to 45 minutes.”</li>
    <li><strong>Quality improvement:</strong> “Increase clarity of participant instructions, measured by fewer follow-up emails or fewer ‘confusion points’ in feedback.”</li>
    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> “Standardize tone and structure across 6 support emails, measured by using a repeatable template + fewer rewrites.”</li>
    <li><strong>Throughput:</strong> “Increase number of usable draft artifacts produced per week (e.g., rubrics, agendas, summaries) without increasing revision burden.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 3 — Identify your use case type (to calibrate risk)</h3>
  <p>
    Risk is shaped by <strong>how AI output is used</strong> and the <strong>impact of being wrong</strong>, not just the tool itself.
    Before you begin, categorize your pilot work:
  </p>

  <div class="table-wrap" role="region" aria-label="Risk calibration table" tabindex="0">
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Use Type</th>
          <th>What it looks like</th>
          <th>Typical risk level</th>
          <th>What to do differently</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Draft support</th>
          <td>First drafts, brainstorming, outline building, rewriting for clarity</td>
          <td>Lower</td>
          <td>Human review is usually sufficient; verify facts and citations as needed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Operational support</th>
          <td>Summarizing meetings, drafting internal comms, organizing plans, basic analysis</td>
          <td>Medium</td>
          <td>Review for accuracy, completeness, and tone; watch for missed context or subtle errors</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Assessment or decision-adjacent</th>
          <td>Quiz questions, rubrics, evaluation language, student-facing guidance, decision support</td>
          <td>Higher</td>
          <td>Increase validation: bias checks, alignment review, pilot testing, and a clear human accountability step</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <h3>Step 4 — Use reasonable documentation standards</h3>
  <p>
    The goal is not surveillance—it’s to capture enough evidence to decide what should scale and what should not.
    Keep documentation light but consistent throughout the pilot.
  </p>

  <h4>Minimum documentation (recommended)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use log (weekly):</strong> 3–5 bullets about what you did with the tool and what happened.</li>
    <li><strong>Artifacts (when relevant):</strong> Save one example input/output pair or “before/after” draft.</li>
    <li><strong>Reflection note:</strong> What improved? What stayed hard? What risks or failures showed up?</li>
    <li><strong>Time estimate:</strong> Rough time saved (or time added) compared to your normal process.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Documentation prompt (copy/paste):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Task:</strong> What did I try to do?</li>
      <li><strong>Tool + feature:</strong> What did I use (e.g., Word drafting, chat, file analysis)?</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> What did it produce?</li>
      <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Did it reduce time, improve quality, or reduce friction?</li>
      <li><strong>Risk check:</strong> What could have gone wrong, and how did I mitigate it?</li>
      <li><strong>Next iteration:</strong> What will I change next time?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>Step 5 — Deliverables (what you submit at the end)</h3>
  <p>
    These deliverables help the pilot generate usable institutional learning.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tool choice + rationale</strong> (2–4 sentences)</li>
    <li><strong>Measurable goal statement</strong> (from Step 2)</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence bundle</strong> (one of the following):
      <ul>
        <li>2–3 short use-log entries + 1–2 artifacts, <em>or</em></li>
        <li>1 short case study (½–1 page) describing what changed</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Risk reflection</strong>: What risk level did your use case fall into, and what mitigations were necessary?</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation</strong> (choose one): “Scale,” “Scale with conditions,” or “Do not scale.” Include a sentence explaining why.</li>
